# Steve's Portfolio POC

## What is this project?

This project was multi purpose. I knew that I wanted to do the following things

1. Contribute to my public Github profile to demonstrate my technical capabilities
1. Explore new technologies (Parcel.js, TailwindCSS)
1. Create a place that I can use to post blog posts about technical projects. More specifically, I wanted to explore using markdown files in the filesystem as a content management system.

Ultimately, I completed the first 2 objectives, and have set myself up for the third. I am concluding my work on this project and starting a new one.

## What did I learn from this POC?

In order to accomplish my goal of using .md files in the filesystem as a content management system, I realized that Parcel is probably not the best tool. Parcel is great and I will definitely use it again for future projects. In order to mess with the filesystem though I need server side code, making me lean towards a SSR approach over delivering a single SPA. 

I plan on writing a blog post about this in the near future, on the new portfolio I will create. I plan on using Next.js to create a SSR app. This is better for SEO too, which is an added bonus if I ever want to try and reach a wider audience than job recruiters.
